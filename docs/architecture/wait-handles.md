# Wait Handles

## Overview

Wait handles are a unified durable-suspend mechanism for tools that need human input. A tool that asks the user a question writes a row to the `tool_wait_handles` table; the dispatch arm then raises a sentinel exception that unwinds the model loop without emitting a `tool_result`. The dangling `tool_use` left on disk is closed on the next run by the resume bucket, which reads the (then-resolved) DB row.

The DB row is the source of truth. There is no in-process future registry, no live `notify_resolved` fast path, and no shutdown drain -- everything blocking on the user goes through the same suspend / resume cycle, so a server restart between registration and resolution is indistinguishable from a same-process resolution.

The mechanism currently backs four call sites:

- `wait_for_handles` -- generic tool surface for blocking on one or more outstanding handle ids. The `run_user_subagent` execute path returns a `user_subagent`-kind handle id that the caller's model blocks on this way (see [Cross-User Subagents](user-subagents.md)); otherwise the tool is kept for resume-bucket compatibility and future opt-in waits.
- `send_slack_reply_and_get_response` -- Slack-driven thread suspend (see [Slack Socket Mode](slack-socket-mode.md)). The reply is keyed implicitly by `(channel, thread_ts)` via the row payload, and the Socket Mode debounce flush resolves the row directly. Always blocking via `SuspendForSlackReply`.
- `create_action_request` -- inline Approve / Revise / Stop card. Always blocking via `SuspendForActionRequest`: the dispatch arm raises the sentinel after persisting the rows and emitting the websocket event, and the resume bucket closes the dangling `create_action_request` tool_use with the wait-handle row's `response` on resolve.
  - The resolve endpoint handles all three buttons and updates both the `action_requests` row and the linked wait handle; on Revise, the user's feedback rides on the wait-handle response so the resumed model can react to it.
  - Stop is the odd one out: the handle becomes terminal (`stopped`, so the composer unlocks and the inbox drops the row) but NO resume is kicked and `_run_resume()` holds on stopped rows -- the tool_use is closed only by the user's next send, with a `stopped` verdict and that message in the same turn.
  - Memory writes use `request_type="create_memory"` and ride on this path. See [Action Requests](action-requests.md).
- `return_to_caller` -- a cross-user subagent's return proposal. Rides on an `action_request`-kind handle and `SuspendForActionRequest` like the generic card, but its deny branch has bespoke semantics (Revise re-drives the subagent under `chat/user_subagent.py`'s control with the generic resume kick suppressed; hard Deny ends the run and never resumes the subagent conversation). See [Cross-User Subagents](user-subagents.md).

## Key Files

- `db/models.py` -- `ToolWaitHandle` ORM model; `ToolWaitHandleKind` (`slack_reply`, `action_request`, `user_subagent`); `ToolWaitHandleStatus`. The schema column is `String(50)` so adding kinds requires no migration. See [Database Architecture](database.md)
- `db/tool_wait_handle_store.py` -- async CRUD plus `find_pending_slack_reply(channel, thread_ts)`, `find_pending_for_action_request(user_id, request_id)`, `bulk_get_handles_by_ids`, `mark_timed_out`, `cancel_pending_for_conversation`, `get_handle_by_tool_id`. `create_handle()` accepts optional `correlation_kind` / `correlation_id` for kinds where the linkage is known up front (used by `action_request`)
- `chat/gemini_api/turn_tools.py` -- `SuspendForWaitHandles`, `SuspendForSlackReply`, and `SuspendForActionRequest` sentinel classes; `_await_wait_for_handles`, `_build_wait_for_handles_result`; the per-tool dispatch handlers that register handles and raise the sentinels
- `chat/gemini_api/conversation.py` -- the top-level `run_conversation_turn()` catches all three sentinels and returns cleanly, and the resume bucket logic at the top of the same function closes the dangling tool_use on the next run
- `chat/wait_handles/wait_timer.py` -- per-handle `asyncio.Task` that enforces `timeout_seconds`. On expiry, marks the row `timed_out` and calls `maybe_kick_resume`. Replaces the deleted in-process future registry; the DB `expires_at` sweep remains the restart-resilience fallback
- `chat/wait_handles/resume.py` -- `maybe_kick_resume`, `_run_resume`, `_conversation_has_dangling_wait`, `_conversation_has_dangling_slack_reply`. Drives a fresh headless `run_conversation_turn()` with `message=""` and preserves `origin` + `slack_context` so Slack-origin resumes boot with the right tools
- `chat/wait_handle_routes.py` -- REST endpoints (`GET /app/api/wait-handles/{id}`, `POST /app/api/wait-handles/{id}/resolve`); always calls `maybe_kick_resume` on success
- `chat/action_request_routes.py` -- `POST /app/api/action-requests/{id}/resolve` resolves the linked `kind="action_request"` handle (via `find_pending_for_action_request`) and kicks `maybe_kick_resume` after the action_request row is flipped. See [Action Requests](action-requests.md)
- `chat/realtime/socket.py` -- the persistent-WS `{op:"stop"}` handler unconditionally calls `cancel_pending_wait_handles_for_conversation` (the `_run_send_message` task body's `CancelledError` arm does the same on its way out). The legacy `confirm_action_result` WebSocket bridge in `chat/routes/_helpers.py` was removed in devplan 00062; clients use the REST resolve endpoints exclusively
- `chat/llm/tool_schemas.py` -- `wait_for_handles` tool spec (required `reason`, optional `timeout_seconds`, max 8 handle ids per call)
- `alembic/versions/c1f2a3d4e5b6_create_tool_wait_handles.py` -- creates the table and its indexes
- `alembic/versions/3b9d4f7c2e10_cancel_pending_memory_suggestions.py` -- one-shot data migration that cancels any historical `pending` rows of retired kinds so they cannot strand resumes
- `frontend/src/components/ToolUseMessage.tsx` -- renders `Waiting for: <reason>` in place of `wait_for_handles`
- `frontend/src/api/client.ts` / `frontend/src/api/types.ts` -- `WaitHandle` type, `resolveWaitHandle(handleId, status, options)`
- `quest.py` -- registers `wait_handle_router`. No lifespan shutdown drain: pending rows survive restart and resume from DB on next boot

## Data Model

`tool_wait_handles` rows are owned by a user, scoped to a conversation, and identified by a UUID. The `kind` column discriminates between `slack_reply` (Slack-driven thread suspend) and `action_request` (inline Approve / Revise / Stop card); both share the same lifecycle.

`tool_id` is the LLM tool_use id of the registering call and is indexed so the resume bucket can look it up by tool id. `payload` carries kind-specific content (`{channel, thread_ts, posted_text, posted_ts}` for slack replies; `{request_id, request_type, params}` for action requests).

`response` is populated on resolve and carries kind-specific resolution data (the user's Slack reply text, or `{verdict, request_id, feedback?, result}` for action requests -- `feedback` is present at the top level on a Revise denial so the resumed model can read it directly without descending into `result`).

`correlation_kind` / `correlation_id` are populated **at create time** for `action_request` (the `action_requests.id` is in hand when the wait handle is inserted, so `find_pending_for_action_request()` can index the lookup by it). The `String(50)` `kind` column also accommodates legacy historical rows from now-retired kinds without a schema change.

`ToolWaitHandleStatus` defines the lifecycle: `pending` -> `accepted` | `rejected` | `cancelled` | `timed_out`. Indexes (`user_id`, `conversation_id`, `(user_id, status)`, `tool_id`) cover the access patterns of the resume path, the per-conversation cancellation, and the lookup-by-tool-id used by the resume bucket. See [Database Architecture](database.md) for the column-by-column schema and [Constraints](#constraints).

## Tool Surface

`wait_for_handles` is exposed via the standard `tool_call` meta-tool path; its declaration is in `TOOL_CALL_REGISTRY` in `chat/llm/tool_schemas.py`. The model passes `handle_ids` (1--8 strings), a required human-readable `reason` (rendered verbatim by the UI as `Waiting for: <reason>`; truncated at 200 chars), and an optional `timeout_seconds`.

The tool description steers the model to omit `timeout_seconds` for the normal human-in-the-loop case; when omitted, the call effectively blocks until a handle resolves or up to the maximum (~14 days). When set, values are clamped to [1, `_WAIT_FOR_HANDLES_MAX_TIMEOUT`] (defined in `chat/gemini_api/conversation.py`). The tool returns `{"resolved": [...], "still_pending": [...], "unknown": [...]}` from a fresh DB read on every wake.

Tools that block on user input do **not** themselves use a model-facing tool to register a handle. They call `tool_wait_handle_store.create_handle()` from the dispatch arm (the `send_slack_reply_and_get_response` handler and the `create_action_request` handler in `chat/gemini_api/turn_tools.py`), append a corresponding structured message (`action_request` for action requests, or none for Slack replies -- the tool_use itself is the marker), emit any associated event, and then raise `SuspendForSlackReply` (Slack reply -- always blocking) or `SuspendForActionRequest` (action request -- always blocking; the model gets the verdict directly from the tool's return value on resume).

`wait_for_handles` is top-level only:

- **Sub-agents** -- excluded from the dynamic tools section because there is no UI channel to a sub-agent's user; the resume bucket logic also lives only in the top-level `run_conversation_turn()` loop.
- **Slack-driven runs** -- the `tool_call` arm short-circuits with a structured JSON error when `is_slack_origin` is true and the inner tool name is `wait_for_handles`. Slack runs use the implicit `slack_reply` wait handle registered by `send_slack_reply_and_get_response`; see [Slack Socket Mode](slack-socket-mode.md).

## Suspend / Resume

The dispatch arm of any blocking tool follows the same shape:

1. Insert a `pending` row via `create_handle()`.
2. Save `sdk_history.json` -- already done by the boundary save in `_capturing_on_event` at the `tool_use` event for the registering call; see [SDK History Persistence](gemini-api.md#sdk-history-persistence).
3. For `wait_for_handles`: schedule a per-handle expiry timer via `wait_timer.schedule_timeout_for_handles()`, then raise `SuspendForWaitHandles`.
   For `send_slack_reply_and_get_response`: post the Slack reply via `slack_driven_runtime.post_thread_reply()`, then raise `SuspendForSlackReply`.
   For `create_action_request`: emit the `action_request` websocket event and append the structured chat-history message, then raise `SuspendForActionRequest`. This sentinel alone is caught **inside** the dispatch loop's per-call arm: the loop records it, keeps dispatching the remaining calls of the same parallel batch (each further `create_action_request` opens another card + row; regular tools run and persist their `tool_result`), then re-raises the first sentinel after the batch with the other cards' handle ids on `sibling_handle_ids`.
4. The top-level `run_conversation_turn()` catches the sentinel, logs an info line, and returns the structured-messages list cleanly. No error event is emitted; this is a successful suspend, not a turn-end.

On disk, `sdk_history.json` ends on an assistant turn whose last content block is the dangling tool_use (`wait_for_handles`, `send_slack_reply_and_get_response`, or `create_action_request`). The `chat_history.json` flush events that drive the boundary save are listed in `chat/_flush_helper.py` (`FLUSH_EVENT_TYPES`).

Resolution writes the row first (first writer wins via the `status == PENDING` precondition in `resolve_handle()`), then calls `wait_resume.maybe_kick_resume(app, user, conversation_id)`. Callers:

- `POST /app/api/wait-handles/{id}/resolve` (`chat/wait_handle_routes.py`) -- explicit accept/decline/cancel; the only client today is the legacy timeout / cancel flow, since the action-request resolve endpoint does its own resolve.
- `POST /app/api/action-requests/{id}/resolve` (`chat/action_request_routes.py`) -- the Approve / Revise / Stop path; resolves the linked `kind="action_request"` handle and kicks the resume (Approve / Revise only -- Stop resolves the handle as `stopped` without a kick, and stops the conversation's other open cards too). `create_memory` action requests insert the new memory row inside the handler's `execute()` so the row id is on `result.memory_id`.
- `slack_driven_runtime._flush_after()` -- Slack debounce flush that resolves a `slack_reply` row with the collated user text.
- `wait_timer._expire_after()` -- background timeout that flips `pending` to `timed_out` and kicks resume so the model wakes with a final status.

All resolution paths additionally publish `wait_handle_resolved` on the user channel so a viewing tab updates in place; the action-request path also publishes `request_count_changed` / `conversation_list_changed` as appropriate. See [Realtime Architecture](realtime.md).

`maybe_kick_resume` is dedupe-safe via a per-conversation `_active_resumes` map and is gated by `_conversation_has_dangling_wait`, which delegates to the provider (via the shared `_pending_tool_uses()` reader) to inspect `sdk_history.json` for a dangling `wait_for_handles`, `send_slack_reply_and_get_response`, or `create_action_request` tool_use. If the saved transcript has already moved past the wait, the kick is a no-op.

**Multi-card gate.** A parallel tool-call batch can leave several dangling `create_action_request` tool_uses, one pending row each. `_run_resume()` therefore starts with `_unresolved_blocking_handle_ids(user_id, conversation_id)`: the still-`pending` rows of kind `action_request` / `slack_reply` (the one-row-per-tool_use kinds; `wait_for_handles` rows belong to other tools and keep their any-resolves contract) whose `tool_id` is one of the dangling tool_uses.

While that list is non-empty the resume returns before publishing `resume_started` -- nothing streams, the composer stays locked on the remaining `pending_wait_handles` -- and the resolve of the last card kicks the resume that actually runs, so the model receives every verdict in one go.

Scoping by dangling `tool_id` means a stale pending row from an older turn cannot wedge the conversation; a failing check falls through to the pre-gate behavior.

Web-side runs are serialized per conversation: a headless resume and a persistent-WS send must never drive `run_conversation_turn` concurrently, because both append to the same shared in-memory session and interleaved appends orphan `tool_use` blocks mid-history (Anthropic then rejects every later call with a 400). Two cross-guards enforce this.

The WS `send_message` handler rejects with reason `already_running` while `wait_resume.is_resuming(conversation_id)` is true (mirroring the existing second-tab send lock), and `maybe_kick_resume` defers -- via a done-callback on the blocking task -- when `chat.realtime.socket.get_active_send_run(conversation_id)` reports an in-flight send.

The same done-callback mechanism re-kicks after an in-flight *resume* completes, so a resolution that lands while the previous resume task is still unwinding is re-checked rather than silently dropped (the re-entry no-ops via `_conversation_has_dangling_wait` when nothing is left to drive).

As defense in depth, `run_conversation_turn` calls `provider.repair_session_history()` right after obtaining the session: the Anthropic override closes orphaned mid-history `tool_use` blocks with a synthetic `interrupted` result and drops stray/duplicate `tool_result` blocks in place (a dangling tool_use on the *final* message is left for the resume bucket), so a conversation whose history was corrupted before the guards shipped self-heals on its next run. Slack-driven runs keep their own registry-based mutual exclusion in `slack_driven_runtime._active_runs`.

`_run_resume()` reads the conversation's stored `origin` and -- for `origin="slack"` -- the matching `slack_conversations` row, so the headless `run_conversation_turn(message="", origin=..., slack_context=...)` boots with the right tool set. Slack-origin resumes register the task in `slack_driven_runtime._active_runs` so `is_run_active()` reflects the in-flight resume, and the typing indicator is set on resume start and cleared in `finally` (or left alone if the run suspends again on another `slack_reply`).

`_run_resume()` also publishes the same run-lifecycle envelopes as a WS send on the conversation channel: `resume_started` on entry and `send_message_finished {interrupted, error}` in its `finally` (the pair is emitted inside the coroutine, so a task cancelled before its first tick emits neither and a client can never latch a streaming state with no terminal event). Transient events (`text_delta`, sub-agent updates) are mirrored via `chat.realtime.socket._publish_transient_event`, exactly like `_run_send_message`.

The FE reacts to `resume_started` by entering the normal streaming/stop composer state (`webSocketManager.attachToResumeStream`), so after an action-request Approve / Revise the composer shows the stop button (a card Stop kicks no resume, so the composer simply unlocks) -- not an enabled input whose send would bounce off the `already_running` guard -- until the resume finishes.

The WS `stop` handler cancels an active resume via `wait_resume.get_active_resume(conversation_id)`; the cancelled resume saves the interrupted SDK history, appends the durable `interrupted` marker, and reports `send_message_finished {interrupted: true}`.

The resume bucket at the top of `run_conversation_turn()` walks the dangling tool_uses, looks up each one's `tool_id` in `tool_wait_handles`, and closes them:

- `kind="slack_reply"` -- closed with `{"user_reply": ..., "posted_ts": ...}` from the row's `response` and `payload`. If the row is somehow still `pending` when the resume runs, a `{"status": "still_waiting"}` marker is used instead.
- `kind="action_request"` -- closed with the row's `response` dict verbatim: `{"verdict": "executed", "request_id": N, "result": {...}}` for Approve, `{"verdict": "denied", "request_id": N, "result": {"denied": true}}` plus a top-level `feedback` field (mirrored inside `result.feedback`) for Revise.
  - A `stopped` row (Stop) is closed with its `{"verdict": "stopped", ...}` response plus a `note` built by `_stopped_action_request_result()` saying the request was not executed and that the user's new message follows in this turn (a different note when the run carries no message).
  - If the row is still `pending` when the resume runs (race with the resolve endpoint), a `{"status": "still_waiting"}` marker is used instead.
  - This branch matches before the `wait_for_handles` catch-all so an action_request row never funnels through `_build_wait_for_handles_result`.
- Any `wait_for_handles` / `tool_call(tool_name="wait_for_handles")` tool_use, with or without a row -- closed with `_build_wait_for_handles_result(user_id, handle_ids)` from a fresh DB read. A model that emits a follow-up `wait_for_handles(handle_ids=[<id>])` after a now-blocking `create_action_request` short-circuits here: the row is already terminal, so the live arm returns the resolved-row projection immediately without registering a new suspend.
- Any other dangling tool_use with no wait-handle row -- closed with its own persisted `tool_output` replayed from `chat_history.json` (`_load_persisted_tool_results()` in `chat/gemini_api/conversation.py`) when the call did run but the batch unwound on a sibling `create_action_request` suspend before `format_tool_results`; otherwise (cancellation / restart mid-tool) with the synthetic `{"status": "interrupted", ...}` marker. Provider-side extra parts (e.g. a Gemini file part) are not replayed, only the text output.

When the resume runs with `message=""` and there is no dangling tool_use, the loop bails before invoking the model so it does not run a turn against empty user input.

`cancel_pending_for_conversation()` flips every still-pending row in the conversation to `cancelled`. The persistent-WS `{op:"stop"}` handler in `chat/realtime/socket.py` calls it unconditionally so a stop click on a sentinel-suspended run (where the API task already returned successfully) does not leave rows pending with nobody to resolve them.

## Composer Sync

The web composer is locked on any conversation whose suspended turn still has a `pending` wait-handle row, regardless of which tab loaded the conversation or whether a stream is in flight. The gate is driven by the DB row, not by per-tab streaming state, so a fresh conversation load (Requests-pane navigation, page reload, second tab) lands with the composer already disabled.

Two channels keep the FE in sync:

- `GET /conversations/{id}` returns a `pending_wait_handles` array projected from `tool_wait_handle_store.list_pending_for_conversation`, with `{id, kind, correlation_id, created_at}` per row. `chat/routes/conversations.py` populates the field; `chat/storage.py` carries it on `ConversationDetail`. `useConversation` seeds `conversationStore.pendingWaitHandles[conversationId]` from this field on load and on every resync refetch, and also derives entries from newly-arrived open `action_request` messages in tail / catchup paths so a same-tab `create_action_request` locks the composer at the flush boundary without a round-trip through the detail endpoint.
- `wait_handle_resolved` events on the persistent WebSocket -- now also emitted by `cancel_pending_wait_handles_for_conversation` in `chat/gemini_api/session.py` with `status="cancelled"` for each row it flips, so the persistent-WS `{op:"stop"}` handler unlocks the composer across tabs without waiting for a tail refetch -- call `removePendingWaitHandle` in the FE on every termination (accept / reject / cancel / timeout). See [Realtime Architecture](realtime.md).

`conversationStore` exposes `pendingWaitHandles: PendingWaitInfo[]` per conversation with mutators `setPendingWaitHandles` / `removePendingWaitHandle` and the selector `hasPendingWaitHandle(conversationId)`. `useConversation` re-exports `hasPendingWait` and `pendingWaitKind`; `ChatPanel` ORs `hasPendingWait` into `inputDisabled` and uses `pendingWaitKind === "action_request"` to swap the textarea placeholder to "Approve, revise, or stop the pending request to continue.". The same gate also blocks paste. Slack-origin conversations were already read-only via the `origin === "slack"` gate; the new OR makes no observable difference there but covers `slack_reply` waits if `origin` gating is ever relaxed.

## REST Endpoints

`chat/wait_handle_routes.py` exposes:

- `GET /app/api/wait-handles/{handle_id}` -- returns the row scoped to the authenticated user (404 if not found or owned by someone else).
- `POST /app/api/wait-handles/{handle_id}/resolve` -- body fields are defined by `ResolveWaitHandleRequest` in the same file: `status` (must be `accepted`, `rejected`, or `cancelled`), optional `response` dict, optional `correlation_kind` / `correlation_id`, optional `feedback` (merged into `response`). Returns 400 on bad status, 404 if missing, 400 if already resolved, 409 if a concurrent resolver won the row first. On success, always calls `maybe_kick_resume`. See [Chat API](../api/chat-api.md) for the full endpoint catalog.

The `POST /app/api/action-requests/{id}/resolve` endpoint in `chat/action_request_routes.py` is the primary client of the wait-handle resolve path: it bridges to `tool_wait_handle_store.resolve_handle()` and `maybe_kick_resume()` after flipping the `action_requests` row. See [Action Requests](action-requests.md).

## Constraints

- The `tool_wait_handles` table is created by `alembic/versions/c1f2a3d4e5b6_create_tool_wait_handles.py`. The `kind` column is `String(50)`, so adding new kinds is a code-only change.
- `wait_for_handles` accepts at most 8 handle ids per call. `timeout_seconds` defaults to `_WAIT_FOR_HANDLES_MAX_TIMEOUT` (currently 1,209,600 s, ~14 days) and is clamped to [1, that maximum]. `reason` is required and truncated to 200 characters before storage / display.
- Per-handle expiry timers in `wait_timer.py` are in-memory `asyncio.Task`s and are lost on process restart. The DB `expires_at` sweep is the restart-resilience fallback. `_build_wait_for_handles_result()` does not yet flip rows whose `expires_at` is past to `timed_out` on read; the TODO note is in that function.
- Headless resume is durable across restarts and now pushes the streamed continuation to viewing tabs via the persistent multiplexed WebSocket. The same `make_flush_callback` that drove the originating run wires through `_run_resume`, so each `chat_history.json` append publishes `message_appended` to every subscriber on the conversation channel; a tab open on the conversation REST-fetches the new tail and renders without a reload. See [Realtime Architecture](realtime.md).
- `wait_for_handles` is excluded from sub-agent tool sets and from Slack-driven runs; the dispatch arms short-circuit with a structured error before any wait-handle row is inserted. See [Route Dispatch](route-dispatch.md) and [Slack Socket Mode](slack-socket-mode.md).

## Design Decisions

**Why a single sentinel-and-resume mechanism instead of three separate paths?**
Each blocking site uses one sentinel-exception-plus-DB-row pattern: one suspend protocol, one resume bucket, one cancellation primitive, one set of restart-resilience invariants. `create_action_request` and `send_slack_reply_and_get_response` raise their own sentinels (`SuspendForActionRequest`, `SuspendForSlackReply`) so the resume bucket can match by row `kind`. Every register site that wakes the model now blocks directly -- there is no synchronous-pending opt-in case where the model has to remember to call `wait_for_handles`.

**Why no in-process future registry?**
Tying wait state to the lifecycle of an in-memory future couples resolution to the lifecycle of the process. A restart, an OOM, or a coroutine cancellation between registration and resolution silently drops the wait. With the DB row as truth and resume always re-spawning a fresh `run_conversation_turn`, same-process and cross-restart resolutions take exactly the same code path -- there is no fast path to keep correct.

**Why a sentinel exception instead of `await`-ing inside the dispatch arm?**
The dispatch arm runs deep inside the streaming-response loop. To suspend cleanly it must unwind the streaming generator, the function-call collection, and the per-turn flush plumbing without emitting a `tool_result` (which would close the dangling tool_use the resume bucket depends on). Raising an exception that the top-level loop catches is the cleanest way to express "stop this turn, leave a dangling tool_use, return cleanly." Inheriting from `Exception` rather than `BaseException` keeps the sentinels out of `CancelledError`'s lane.

**Why does every register-only path now block directly?**
Both remaining register sites are always blocking: the Slack Reply Mode prompt instructs the model to end every turn by calling the reply tool and waiting for the user's next message, and an action request always carries a Revise button whose feedback would otherwise have nowhere to land if the model didn't wait. The previous opt-in pattern (memory suggestions returning a handle id synchronously) made the model responsible for remembering to call `wait_for_handles` -- always-blocking removes that footgun and lets the model read the verdict directly off the tool's return value. All sites share the same wait-handle row and resume bucket.

**Why per-handle `asyncio.Task` timers instead of an `asyncio.wait(timeout=...)` arm?**
Without an in-process future to wait on, there is nothing to attach a timeout to inside the dispatch arm. A small background task per handle gives the same behaviour (mark `timed_out` and wake the conversation on expiry) without coupling the timer to the lifetime of any particular suspend. Resolution before the deadline makes the task a no-op when it eventually fires, which keeps the contract narrow -- timers do not need to be eagerly cancelled on resolve.

**Why does the REST resolver always kick a headless resume?**
There is no live model loop to notify. The dispatch arm raised the sentinel and returned; closing the dangling tool_use requires running the model again. `maybe_kick_resume` is dedupe-safe via `_active_resumes` and is gated on the on-disk transcript actually still ending on a dangling wait, so it is a cheap no-op when there is nothing to drive (e.g., the model already moved past the wait, or two near-simultaneous Accept clicks race).

**Why does the headless-resume continuation reach the open tab?**
Earlier, the resolve endpoint had no handle on the conversation's WebSocket -- it ran from any HTTP context (different browser tab, different device, Slack callback) and could only write to `chat_history.json`. The persistent multiplexed WebSocket fixed this.

The same `make_flush_callback` that the originating run used is also used by `_run_resume`, and the callback now publishes `message_appended` on the per-conversation channel after every disk append. A viewing tab subscribed via the persistent socket fetches the new tail via REST and renders the resumed continuation in place. See [Realtime Architecture](realtime.md) and [Slack Socket Mode -- Web UI Behavior](slack-socket-mode.md#web-ui-behavior).

**Why require `reason` on `wait_for_handles`?**
The chat UI shows `Waiting for: <reason>` in place of the raw tool name, so the value is user-facing. Making it required forces the model to articulate what the user is being asked to do. Empty strings are rejected at validation; oversize strings are silently truncated rather than rejected because the wait should never fail to register over a cosmetic length issue.
