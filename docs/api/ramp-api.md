# Ramp API Documentation

This document describes how Quest reads Ramp spend-management data (card transactions, cards, bills, reimbursements, vendors, statements, accounting data) via the `authed_get` tool.

## Overview

Ramp reads use the `authed_get` tool to make GET requests directly to the Ramp developer API at `https://api.ramp.com/developer/v1/...`. Ramp is a per-user OAuth 2.0 connector (like GitHub and Twitter/X): an admin configures a Ramp OAuth client (client id/secret) in Settings > Service Credentials, then each user connects individually via the Data Connections popup flow. Unlike GitHub, Ramp access tokens **expire** and refresh tokens **rotate on every use**, so the credential loader proactively refreshes near-expiry tokens (the Twitter pattern) and the registry entry additionally sets `retry_on_401` as a backstop. The backend documentation is carried in the `system:ramp` system skill, gated on the `ramp` connection.

## Key Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `auth/ramp.py` | OAuth flow: `GET /auth/ramp` (authorize redirect with all read scopes), `GET /auth/ramp/callback` (code exchange via HTTP Basic client auth, stores `ramp_oauth`), `POST /auth/ramp/disconnect`, and `refresh_ramp_token()` (rotating-refresh-token aware; persists the new refresh token) |
| `auth/config.py` | `RAMP_SCOPES` (every read scope the API offers plus `offline_access`; `cards:read_vault` excluded) and `load_ramp_client_config()` (per-service store only, no legacy fallback) |
| `api/ramp.py` | `get_ramp_token(user)` (proactive refresh inside a 5-minute expiry margin) and `get_instructions(base_url)` for the `system:ramp` skill content |
| `chat/gemini_api/authed_get.py` | `api.ramp.com` entry in `_SERVICE_REGISTRY` (`requires_user`, `retry_on_401`, `missing_credentials_error`, allow-list generated from `_RAMP_READ_RESOURCES` plus explicit cards patterns); `_load_ramp_credentials()` (delegates to `get_ramp_token`, returns `None` on failure) and `_inject_ramp_bearer_auth()` |
| `chat/system_skills/catalog.py` | Registers `system:ramp` gated on `requires="ramp"`; `content_builder` delegates to `api.ramp.get_instructions` |
| `db/models.py` | `ramp_oauth` JSON column on `users` (`access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_at`, `scope`, `token_type`, `authorized_at`); migration `b7d4f21a8c3e` |
| `chat/routes/user.py` | `ramp` entry in `GET /connectors` with `available` (admin credentials present) and `connected`; `ramp_connected` folded into `/me`'s `has_any_service_connected` |
| `chat/routes/admin.py` | `ramp` in `SERVICE_CREDENTIAL_LABELS` / `_SERVICE_FORM_VIEWS` (flat client id/secret form) and `PUT /admin/service-credentials/ramp` |

## OAuth Flow

- **Authorize URL:** `https://app.ramp.com/v1/authorize` (standard authorization-code; Ramp is a confidential client, so no PKCE — HTTP Basic `client_id:client_secret` authenticates the token exchange).
- **Token URL:** `https://api.ramp.com/developer/v1/token` (also used for `grant_type=refresh_token`).
- **Scopes:** `RAMP_SCOPES` in `auth/config.py` requests every `:read` scope grantable to a Ramp developer app plus `offline_access` (required for refresh tokens). `cards:read_vault` (full card numbers/CVVs) is deliberately excluded, and `applications:read` / `incorporation:read` / `spend_requests:read` (present in Ramp's OpenAPI spec but not enableable on apps) are omitted. The admin-created Ramp app must have all requested scopes enabled or the authorize page rejects the request.
- **Token expiry:** Ramp access tokens expire (`expires_at` stored) and refresh tokens rotate on every refresh; `refresh_ramp_token()` persists the rotated refresh token immediately — losing it permanently breaks the connection.

## Ramp Read Access (via `authed_get`)

The `api.ramp.com` registry entry gates paths with an `allowed_endpoints` regex list built from `_RAMP_READ_RESOURCES` — one pattern per resource root (`transactions`, `bills`, `reimbursements`, `users`, `vendors`, `statements`, `accounting`, `audit-logs`, …) matching the root and any sub-path, so list, detail, and nested reads all work. Cards are the exception: `/cards/physical` and `/cards/virtual` (list + detail) are allow-listed explicitly so that the card-vault endpoints (`/cards/vault/...`, `/vault/...` — full card numbers behind the `cards:read_vault` scope) stay unreachable. The token endpoints (`/developer/v1/token`, `/token/revoke`) and webhook config are also not proxied. No `allowed_post_endpoints` list exists, so every POST is rejected — the surface is read-only by construction.

Pagination is cursor-based (`page_size`, `start`; responses carry a `page.next` URL). Amounts are integers in the currency's minor unit. Large responses should use `authed_get`'s `output_file` argument. See `api/ramp.py` (`get_instructions()`) for the LLM-facing path table and examples.

## Connector Availability Gating

`GET /connectors` reports `available: false` for Ramp when no admin has configured Ramp client credentials in the per-service store, and the frontend hides the Data Connections card entirely. Once credentials exist the card appears and users can connect.

## Design Decisions

**Why `authed_get` instead of proxy endpoints?**
Ramp reads are standard REST GETs; reusing `authed_get` gets path gating, credential injection, 401 retry, and large-response protection for free, consistent with GitHub/Airtable/SEC EDGAR.

**Why proactive refresh in the loader AND `retry_on_401`?**
The loader refresh (5-minute margin, `get_ramp_token`) handles the common case without burning a failed request. `retry_on_401` covers clock skew or early revocation-of-access-token races. On refresh failure the loader returns `None` so the model sees the actionable `ramp_oauth_required` reconnect message instead of a raw exception.

**Why resource-root allow-list patterns instead of one regex per endpoint?**
The Ramp read surface is ~80 GET endpoints across ~30 resources and all mutations are POST/PATCH/DELETE (rejected wholesale by the verb-scoped allow-list design), so per-resource patterns keep the list maintainable without loosening the read-only guarantee. The only sensitive GETs — card-vault PANs — live under path roots (`cards/vault`, `vault`) that are excluded from the resource list and covered by explicit cards patterns instead.

**Why exclude `cards:read_vault`?**
Full card numbers are PCI-sensitive and unnecessary for spend analytics. Excluding the scope at authorize time *and* the paths at the allow-list keeps PANs unreachable even if Ramp broadens a token's grants.
