# Google Cloud (GCP) API Documentation

This document describes how Quest reads Google Cloud Platform resources (projects, organizations, IAM policies, Compute Engine VMs/disks, GKE clusters, and Cloud Logging) read-only via the `authed_get` tool and its POST-capable sibling `authed_post`, plus the single approval-gated write: hard-resetting a stuck Compute Engine VM via the `reset_gcp_instance` action request.

## Overview

GCP reads ride on the existing per-user Google Services OAuth credentials -- the same Bearer token used by Gmail/Calendar/Drive/Docs/Sheets/Slides/Tasks -- so there is no separate connection step or Settings entry.

Most GCP reads are plain GET requests made via `authed_get`. The reads Google exposes only as POST (search organizations, read log entries, project-level IAM policy) go through `authed_post`, the POST-capable sibling registered alongside `authed_get` (see [Authenticated External API Requests](../architecture/gemini-api.md#authenticated-external-api-requests-authed_get)).

Four GCP hosts are registered in `_SERVICE_REGISTRY`, all sharing the Google Services loader/injector with `requires_user: True` and `retry_on_401: True`. Access is kept strictly **read-only at the application layer** by the per-host GET/POST allow-lists; the OAuth scope itself is the full `cloud-platform` scope (see Design Decisions).

The backend documentation lives in the gated `system:gcp` system skill rather than always-on prompt text.

## Authentication

GCP reads require the user to have connected Google Services; the four entries share the `_load_google_services_credentials` loader and `_inject_google_bearer_auth` injector with the other Google services, with `requires_user: True` and `retry_on_401: True`.

**OAuth scope required** (added to `GOOGLE_SERVICE_SCOPES` in `auth/config.py`):
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` -- the **full** platform scope, not a read-only variant.

Because it is a new scope, **existing users must re-consent** to the Google Services OAuth grant before GCP requests will succeed; until re-consent, requests fail with a 403 scope/permission error (`ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT`).

Re-consent is detected by the `/connectors` `needs_reauth` check, which compares the stored scope set against `GOOGLE_SERVICE_SCOPES`.

The Google callback in `auth/google_services.py` now persists the scopes Google **actually granted** (`credentials.granted_scopes`, falling back to the requested set only when Google returns no `scope` field) rather than the requested set, so a partial grant (user de-selected a scope on the consent screen) cannot leave a connector showing "Connected" while calls 403.

## GCP Read Access

GCP reads use the full API URL against four hosts, each gated by `allowed_endpoints` (GET) regexes in `chat/gemini_api/authed_get.py` -- non-matching paths are rejected. The id segments use `[^/:]+` (not `[^/]+`) to exclude `:`, which is how GCP encodes custom/write methods (e.g. `instances/{id}:stop`, `clusters/{id}:setMasterAuth`), keeping every GET path read-only. See the registry entries for the exact pattern lists and `api/gcp.py` (`get_instructions()`) for the LLM-facing path tables and example calls.

| Host | API | Capabilities (read-only) |
|------|-----|--------------------------|
| `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com` | Cloud Resource Manager | List/get projects (v1 + v3), get folder, get org by id (GET); search/list organizations and project-level IAM policy (`projects/{id}:getIamPolicy`, v1 + v3) via `authed_post` |
| `compute.googleapis.com` | Compute Engine | VM instances (per-zone, per-instance, aggregated-across-zones; per-instance IAM policy via the slash-style `instances/{id}/getIamPolicy` GET), disks (per-zone, per-instance, aggregated-across-zones for orphaned-disk scans), zones, regions |
| `container.googleapis.com` | Kubernetes Engine (GKE) | List/get clusters and node pools (`location` may be `-` for all locations) |
| `logging.googleapis.com` | Cloud Logging | List/get log names, sinks, log-based metrics (GET); read log **entries** via `authed_post` (`entries:list`) |

### POST Reads (via `authed_post`)

A few GCP reads exist only as POST verbs. They are reachable only through `authed_post` and only via the independent `allowed_post_endpoints` allow-list on their host (a GET can never reach them and vice-versa -- see [authed_post](../architecture/gemini-api.md#post-capable-sibling-authed_post)):

- `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com` -- `POST /v1/organizations:search` (optional `{"query": "..."}` body; empty body lists all visible orgs; the canonical way to discover org ids).
- `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com` -- `POST /v1/projects/{id}:getIamPolicy` and `POST /v3/projects/{id}:getIamPolicy` (project-level IAM policy: who has which roles on the project). POST-but-read-only: the request body schema is `GetIamPolicyRequest`, whose only field is `options` (a `requestedPolicyVersion` hint), so the call cannot carry a policy and cannot mutate -- it returns one. The mutating counterpart is the separate `:setIamPolicy` literal, which the anchored regexes never match (org-, folder-, and `testIamPermissions` verbs are also not allow-listed).
- `logging.googleapis.com` -- `POST /v2/entries:list` (body with `resourceNames`, `filter`, `orderBy`, `pageSize`; the only POST verb allow-listed for this host -- `entries:write` and other write verbs are unreachable).

Instance-level IAM policy on a VM is different: Compute Engine encodes `getIamPolicy` as a plain **GET** path segment (`/compute/v1/projects/{p}/zones/{z}/instances/{i}/getIamPolicy`, no `:`), so it rides on the normal `authed_get` allow-list; the mutating `setIamPolicy` is a POST on a different segment and stays unreachable. The `system:gcp` skill notes that project-level IAM is where bindings usually live (instance-level policies are often empty) and that neither call shows bindings inherited from the folder/org above the project.

### Required `{project}` Parameter and API Enablement

Most GCP paths require a GCP **project id** (not the numeric project number). The skill directs the model to list projects (`GET /v1/projects`) or ask the user when it is unknown. The relevant GCP API must also be enabled on the target project, or Google returns a 403 "API not enabled" error -- a project-side setting, not a Quest issue. Both notes are carried in `api/gcp.py` (`get_instructions()`).

## Write Operations (`reset_gcp_instance` action request)

The one supported GCP write is hard-resetting a stuck Compute Engine VM. It does **not** go through the `authed_get`/`authed_post` allow-lists (those stay strictly read-only; `:`-suffixed verbs like `:reset` are unreachable there). Instead it is the approval-gated `reset_gcp_instance` action request, handled by `ResetGcpInstanceHandler` in `chat/action_request_types/reset_gcp_instance.py` (core type `ActionRequestType.RESET_GCP_INSTANCE` in `db/models.py`, registered in `chat/action_request_types/__init__.py`) -- nothing is sent to Google until the user clicks the card's **Reset** button. See [Action Requests](../architecture/action-requests.md) for the generic approval mechanics.

- **Params:** `project` (GCP project id), `zone` (e.g. `us-central1-a`), `instance` (VM name). All required strings, format-checked (RFC1035 names; project ids admit legacy domain-scoped `example.com:proj` shapes) so the values are URL-path-safe.
- **Proposal-time validation** (`validate_against_upstream`): fetches the live instance (`fields=name,status,machineType`) over the user's Google OAuth token. A 404 (typo'd project/zone/instance) and a powered-off instance (`TERMINATED`/`SUSPENDED` -- reset only applies to a machine that is on) reject same-turn with no card; transient failures (network, 401/403, 5xx) log and defer to execute. On success the live `status` and short machine type are injected as server-only params (`instance_status`, `machine_type`, not in the model-suppliable allow-list) for the preview card.
- **Preview card:** Instance / Zone / Project rows, the live status and machine type when resolved, and a fixed "Effect" row spelling out that a reset is a hard power-cycle (unsaved in-memory data lost, disks untouched).
- **Execute:** pre-checks the Google connection and the `cloud-platform` scope (reauth message on a stale grant), then `POST {COMPUTE_BASE}/compute/v1/projects/{p}/zones/{z}/instances/{i}/reset` via `make_authenticated_request` (401-refresh built in). Returns the Compute operation name/status; Google-side rejections surface via `_extract_google_api_error`.
- **Model-facing spec** lives in the `system:gcp` skill's "GCP Write Operations" section (`api/gcp.py`), including the sub-agent escape-hatch reminder and guidance to read the instance first and to prefer an in-guest reboot when the OS still responds.

Tests: `tests/test_reset_gcp_instance_handler.py`.

## System Skill

GCP usage instructions are surfaced through the gated `system:gcp` skill (`requires="google_services"`), registered in `chat/system_skills/catalog.py` with its content built from `api/gcp.py` (`get_instructions()`). The skill is loadable only when the user has connected Google Services. The `authed_get`/`authed_post` tool schemas in `chat/llm/tool_schemas.py` and the backend prose in `chat/gemini_api/system_prompt.py` name Google Cloud and point the model at `system:gcp`. See [Skill Library](../architecture/skill-library.md).

## Response Size

Aggregated instance/disk lists, full cluster objects, and log pulls commonly exceed the ~3 KB `authed_get`/`authed_post` size gate. The skill directs the model to trim GET responses with the Google `fields=` query parameter and, for large payloads (logs, cluster lists), to pass `output_file` so the body is written under the hidden `.responses/` workspace subdirectory and bypasses the gate. GCP list endpoints paginate (`maxResults` + `pageToken` for Compute; `pageSize` + `pageToken` for the others). See [Large Response Protection](../architecture/gemini-api.md#large-response-protection).

## Constraints

- **Read-only (app-enforced):** only the allow-listed GET paths and the read-shaped POST verbs (`organizations:search`, `entries:list`, project `:getIamPolicy`) are reachable; `:`-suffixed write verbs (incl. `:setIamPolicy`) are excluded by the `[^/:]+` id-segment convention and by the absence of write verbs from the POST allow-lists. The OAuth scope is full `cloud-platform`, so read-only is enforced by the allow-lists, **not** the token. The sole write path is the approval-gated `reset_gcp_instance` action request, which lives outside `authed_get`/`authed_post` entirely and executes only on user Approve.
- **Re-consent required:** the new `cloud-platform` scope requires existing users to reconnect Google Services; until then GCP calls 403 with a scope error.
- **`{project}` id required:** most paths need a project id; list projects or ask the user first.
- **API enablement:** the target GCP API must be enabled on the project or Google returns a 403 "API not enabled".
- **Size gate:** large GCP responses must be trimmed with `fields=` (GET) or streamed via `output_file`.

## Design Decisions

**Why the full `cloud-platform` scope instead of a read-only variant?**
Compute Engine rejects `cloud-platform.read-only` and the GKE/Container API has no read-only scope at all, so the full `cloud-platform` scope is the only one that works across all four APIs. Read-only behavior is therefore enforced at the application layer by the GET/POST allow-lists, which permit only whitelisted read-shaped paths -- never by the OAuth scope. See the rationale comment in `auth/config.py`.

**Why store granted (not requested) OAuth scopes at the callback?**
The `needs_reauth` connector check compares stored scopes against `GOOGLE_SERVICE_SCOPES`. Recording the requested set verbatim would mask a partial grant (user de-selecting a scope on the consent screen), leaving a connector showing "Connected" while API calls 403 with `ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT` -- exactly the GCP symptom. Persisting `credentials.granted_scopes` makes the partial grant visible so re-consent is prompted.

**Why a separate `authed_post` tool instead of relaxing `authed_get`?**
GCP needs a small number of read-shaped POST verbs. Rather than let `authed_get` issue POSTs (which would blur the read-only GET surface), `authed_post` carries POSTs through an **independent** `allowed_post_endpoints` allow-list, strictly separate from the GET allow-list, so a GET can never reach a POST-only path and vice-versa. It is the POST-capable sibling of `authed_get`, not a general POST proxy. See [authed_post](../architecture/gemini-api.md#post-capable-sibling-authed_post).

**Why `authed_get`/`authed_post` instead of dedicated proxy endpoints?**
GCP reads are standard Google API requests. Reusing `authed_get`/`authed_post` inherits the shared credential injection, hostname matching, 401 retry, allow-list path gating, size gate, and `output_file` support, and aligns GCP with Google Calendar, Drive, Slides, and the other Google services.
