"""Ephemeral, in-memory bearer tokens for script-sandbox containers.

Every ``run_script`` / ``run_python`` container used to receive the user's
long-lived ``users.api_key`` as ``QUEST_API_KEY``. That key authenticates
the whole main-app HTTP surface, so any path that carried it out of the
container (echoed tool output, prompt injection, a provider-side leak)
yielded a full-account bearer (issue #201).

This module replaces it with a per-run token:

* :func:`issue_sandbox_token` mints a random ``qsb_``-prefixed token bound
  to one user (and optionally the launching conversation) with a hard
  expiry equal to the container's maximum lifetime plus a small grace.
* :func:`revoke_sandbox_token` drops it the moment the container exits;
  :func:`sandbox_token_lease` wraps both around the container run.
* :func:`resolve_sandbox_token` is what the sandbox tool API server's auth
  dependency (:func:`get_current_sandbox_user`) consults. The main app
  never consults it, so a sandbox token cannot authenticate anything but
  the loopback-only sandbox routes -- and those routes accept nothing
  else (``users.api_key`` and session cookies are rejected there).

The mapping is deliberately process-local: containers die with the server
process, so there is nothing worth persisting, and a restart invalidates
every outstanding token by construction.
