    """Append an interruption marker to the on-disk SDK history if safe.

    With the boundary save hook in ``run_conversation_turn`` writing
    ``sdk_history.json`` on every flush event, the on-disk file is
    already up to date as of the most recent flush boundary. The only
    state this helper still needs to capture is partial assistant text
    that was streamed AFTER the last flush event but BEFORE the user
    cancelled (e.g. mid-stream cancel during the first text block of a
    turn, before any tool_use fires).

    Behaviour:

    1. If ``sdk_history.json`` does not exist on disk, do nothing -- the
       turn was cancelled before anything was persisted and the
       in-memory session is being discarded anyway.
    2. If the on-disk history ends on a dangling tool_use (no matching
       tool_result), do nothing -- writing text after a tool_use would
       break Anthropic's tool_use/tool_result alternation, and the
       resume path will close the tool_use with the user's next reply.
    3. If there is no partial assistant text in ``shared_messages``,
       do nothing -- the on-disk save is the latest known-good state.
    4. Otherwise, append the partial text plus an interruption marker
       to the last assistant entry's last text block (or as a fresh
       text block if none exists), and write the envelope back.

    Provider format (Gemini vs Anthropic) is detected from the saved
    envelope's ``provider`` field, not from any in-memory session
    object -- this helper no longer touches the live session.

# bridge were removed in devplan 00062 phase 3. API-mode runs are now
# serviced by ``chat/realtime/socket.py:_handle_send_message``; user
# input on blocking tools is resolved exclusively through the REST
# endpoints (``POST /app/api/wait-handles/{id}/resolve``,
# ``POST /app/api/action-requests/{id}/resolve``).
#
# The Docker-based Gemini CLI chat mode (``_handle_docker_mode`` and the
# ``chat_mode`` config knob) was removed entirely when gemini-cli was
# deprecated; all runs go through the API-mode path.
