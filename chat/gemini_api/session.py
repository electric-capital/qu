    Sessions are keyed by (user_id, conversation_id) and held in memory.
    On server restart, the SDK session history is loaded from the saved
    sdk_history.json file and passed to provider.create_session() so the
    model retains full context from prior turns.

    Args:
        provider: LLMProvider instance.
        user_id: User's integer ID.
        conversation_id: Conversation UUID.
        model: Model name string.
        system_prompt: System instruction text.
        history: Optional list of history dicts to initialize the session
            with (loaded from sdk_history.json on restart).
        disk_history: Optional list of history dicts loaded from disk,
            used as a fallback when the in-memory session is discarded
            due to a model change.
        disk_provider: Provider name ('gemini' or 'anthropic') of the
            disk_history data, so we can check format compatibility.
        tools: Optional list of ToolSpec dicts to expose to the session.
            Defaults to TOP_LEVEL_TOOLS. Slack-driven conversations pass
            SLACK_TOP_LEVEL_TOOLS so the model can call
            send_slack_reply_and_get_response.
