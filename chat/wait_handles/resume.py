"""Headless resume of a conversation suspended on a wait sentinel.

When a wait handle is resolved by an HTTP caller (or the Slack socket
worker) after the suspended dispatch arm is gone, this module kicks off
a fresh ``run_conversation_turn`` task that picks up the dangling tool_use and
closes it via the resume path's DB re-query.

Three suspend sentinels feed into here:
* ``wait_for_handles`` (web confirm-action / generic wait flow)
* ``send_slack_reply_and_get_response`` (Slack-driven thread suspend)
* ``create_action_request`` (web action-request Approve / Revise; a Stop
  resolves the handle but deliberately kicks NO resume -- see
  ``_stopped_handle_ids``)

For Slack-origin conversations the resume reads the conversation's
stored ``origin`` and the matching ``slack_conversations`` row so the
restarted ``run_conversation_turn`` boots with the right tools and
``slack_context``; otherwise the model would re-enter web mode and have
no way to reply to the user in Slack.
