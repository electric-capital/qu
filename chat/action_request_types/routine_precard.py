"""Pre-card checks + preview enrichment for routine create/edit action requests.

Runs in the ``create_action_request`` dispatch arm (after
``validate_against_upstream``, before the request row is written), parallel
to ``skill_precard_check``: rejections raise ``ValueError`` so they surface
as same-turn ``Invalid parameters`` with no card, letting the model
self-correct. It performs:

- **Project-scoping pre-check:** both types require a project conversation;
  ``create_routine`` additionally verifies the project exists for the user
  and is not public (public projects cannot have routines), while
  ``edit_routine`` verifies the routine exists and belongs to the
  conversation's project.
- **Name-collision pre-check:** per-project unique routine names, for
  ``create_routine`` always and for ``edit_routine`` only when ``name`` is
  changing.
- **Skill-access pre-check:** every id in ``skill_ids`` (create) /
  ``add_skill_ids`` (edit) must pass ``user_can_access_skill``.
- **Model defaulting (create only):** a ``create_routine`` proposal without
  an explicit ``model`` gets one injected server-side via
  ``pick_default_routine_model`` (Sonnet 5, then Gemini 3.7 Flash, first
  available; unset when neither is), with ``model_defaulted`` set so the
  approval card labels the row as a default rather than an agent choice.
- **Preview enrichment:** injects a ``skill_names`` id->name map for the
  card's skill rows, and -- for ``edit_routine`` -- ``current_routine_name``
  for the card header, the routine row's ``updated_at`` as
  ``expected_updated_at`` (the execute-time optimistic-concurrency token),
  and ``content_diff`` (the ``build_content_diff`` line diff of the current
  vs proposed prompt) when the edit changes the prompt, rendered by the
  same ``skill_content_diff`` preview field the skill edits use.

These are an agent-experience optimization; the execute-time guards in the
handlers remain the authoritative enforcement (TOCTOU close).
