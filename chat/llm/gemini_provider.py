"""Gemini provider implementation using the google-genai SDK.

Wraps the existing Gemini SDK integration to conform to the LLMProvider
interface. All Gemini models run on the Vertex AI backend (google-genai in
Vertex mode, ``vertexai=True``, ADC + project/region). The developer-API
(``genapi``) transport was removed: thought signatures are not portable
across the Vertex / AI Studio border, so mixing backends within one
conversation history produced signature-validation errors on model switch.
File uploads use inline ``Part.from_bytes`` because the developer-API
``files.upload`` endpoint is not available on Vertex.
