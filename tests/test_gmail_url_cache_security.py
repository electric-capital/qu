"""Regression tests for security finding #279217.

An authenticated user could upload a crafted ``url_mappings.sqlite`` into
their own workspace, then point the Gmail Simple URL-lookup route at it via a
path-fragment ``conversation_id`` (e.g. ``<id>/workspace/cache``). The cache
was read through SqliteDict's default pickle codec, executing code in the
server process. These tests lock in the two-part fix: (1) the cache path
resolver rejects non-canonical conversation ids, and (2) values are stored and
read as JSON, never pickled, so a planted database cannot execute code. They
also cover the ownership guard on the lookup routes.
