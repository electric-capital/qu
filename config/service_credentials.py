"""Per-service upstream credential store.

Server-level credentials for upstream API integrations live in individual
per-service JSON files under ``DATA_DIR / "service_credentials"`` (one
``<service>.json`` per service, mode 0600, directory mode 0700) so admins
can manage them from the Settings UI without touching the filesystem.

Historically all server credentials lived in the consolidated
``server_credentials.json`` at the project root (except Twitter/X, which
had its own ``twitter_credentials.json``). ``migrate_legacy_credentials()``
runs at startup and copies known sections from those files into the
per-service store. When a service exists in both places the per-service
file wins: loaders call ``read_service_credentials()`` first and only fall
back to the legacy file when the store has nothing for that service. The
legacy files are never modified or deleted.

Store files are encrypted at rest: the JSON document is wrapped as
``{"encrypted": "qenc1:..."}`` via ``config/encryption.py`` (context label
``service_credentials/<service>``). Reads tolerate a plaintext JSON file --
the prod bootstrap wizard and local-mode pre-baking (``run.py``, both
stdlib-only and running before the encryption password is known) write
plaintext, and ``encrypt_plaintext_credential_files()`` (the
``config.encryption init`` step and the app lifespan) converts those in
place. Keeping the file a JSON object means the stdlib-only readers that
only test for presence (``scripts/bootstrap_prod.py``, ``run.py``) keep
working.

This module keeps its top-level imports to the Python standard library
(mirroring ``config/paths.py``) so it can be imported very early in the
application lifecycle; the encryption module is stdlib at import time too.
